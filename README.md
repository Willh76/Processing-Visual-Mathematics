# Rotating Triangles
Draws and transforms multiple equilactral triangles which will rotate out of phase with each other to produce complex patterns

# Spirograph
A spirograph works by combining circular motions to create geometric patterns. The main idea is based on the motion of one circle rolling inside or outside another fixed circle.

This can be modelled by mapping a point on a circle which is rotating around a larger, outside circle, using sine and cosine operators.

# Harmonograph

A harmonograph is a mechanical device designed to create geometric patterns. These patterns are generated by the motion of pendulums that swing in different directions and frequencies, translating their movements into artistic designs.

The harmonograph typically consists of two or more pendulums connected to a drawing arm or a pen that traces patterns onto a surface, such as paper. The pendulums move in perpendicular directions or rotate at varying speeds, creating overlapping motions.
